## About

A plugin extends Elgg's [bookmarklet](https://fails.us/bookmarks) feature
to work on all websites instead of just the browser bar.

*Inbound Wire and Bookmarks* enables "share buttons" on websites around the web
to "share this page" to `your elgg site` just as though they would share to
Facebook, Twitter, etc.

## Be like Twitter

Every website should feature a "talk about this" button: <a href="https://fails.us/thewire?u=http://URL.com&text=description"><img src="https://fails.us/cache/1555957203/default/images/fu32.png"></a>
It works just "tweet this" buttons or links only it goes to your Elgg site.
Click the button to post this site URL and description to the wire.
example link: `https://mysite.com/thewire?u=http://URL.com&text=description`

## Be like Facebook

Every website should feature a "bookmark this" button. ![talk about this](https://fails.us/cache/1555957203/default/images/fu32.png)
It works just "share to Facebook" buttons only it goes to your Elgg site.
The button, when clicked, creates a bookmark under their username.

## Installation
